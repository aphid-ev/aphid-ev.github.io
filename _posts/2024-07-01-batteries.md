*This post is just a draft, there will be more schematics and diagrams coming...*

The battery will be built of modules from a donor EV, which type will be determined by the availability. Hopefully we could come by a cost effective 24 kWh Nissan Leaf battery,

Since the VW Beetle is quite small, the battery will be needed to be divided into two parts. One rear battery between the back seat and the rear firewall. and one front battery in the frunk where the gas tank normally is. Depending on the modules the batteries will be connected in series or paralell to reach a nominal voltage of `~350-400 V` and deliver `~200 A`.

## Front battery
The front battery will contain the [precharge](/posts/main_contactors/#precharge) circuit and the service disconnect.

## Rear battery
*TBD*
