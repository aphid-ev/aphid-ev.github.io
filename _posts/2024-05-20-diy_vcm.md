# DIY VCM (Vehicle Control Module)
While re-using all power electronics components from the donor cars makes sense. My idea is to create a DIY version of what Nissan call a VCM, so I'll stick with that nomenclature here as well. The VCM is the control unit that manage all main functions of the vecicle and control all other components.

The easiest way to follow the development is through this [GitHub](https://github.com/aphid-ev/vehicle-controller) repository that will contain both the hardware and firmware.

## Safety
Since this VCM will be used to control a car and the systems contain dangerously high voltage, safety is very important. There are a few different parts that will achieve a robust design:
- Dual channel system consisting of a monitoring MCU for critical signals like Accelerator input, torque request, main contactors etc.
- Firmware developed in Rust which is a very robust and safe language.
- Electrical system designed with safety in mind.

## Hardware
The PCB is created in the open source [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) software.

### Enclosure
The idea is to use the pretty robust ModICE ME-MX 24 enclosure.

### Microcontrollers
The main formware will run in an STM32F405RB microcontroller and there will be a smaller STM32F031K6 for monitoring the main application.

### I/O
*TBD*

## Firmware
The firmware will be developed using the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Both because it provides a lot of nice security features and it is very nice to work with.
